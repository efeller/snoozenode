# snoozenode

This is the core system management component of Snooze, a scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual machine (VM) management 
framework for private clouds. Snooze is one of the core results of [Eugen Feller`s](http://www.irisa.fr/myriads/members/efeller) PhD thesis 
under the supervision of [Dr. Christine Morin](http://www.irisa.fr/myriads/members/cmorin/) at the INRIA [MYRIADS project-team](http://www.irisa.fr/myriads) 
in Rennes, France. It has been verified on the [Grid`5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/) as well as on the [EDF (Électricité de France)](http://www.edf.fr) 
experimentation testbeds and is now used within the MYRIADS project-team in various cloud computing research activities.

The key features of the framework are:

* Self-organization and healing
* Overload and underload detection
* Dynamic VM relocation and consolidation
* Power management
* Live migration
* Generic scheduler
